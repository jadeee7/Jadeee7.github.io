ABC iView add-on for Kodi/XBMC
================================

This is a simple ABC iView add-on for Kodi/XBMC that allows you to stream
iView programs.

The content is only available with Australia, or you can use Smart DNS/Proxies
like Unblock-US, UnoTelly or GetFlix or your own VPN solution which
uses an Australian endpoint.

This add-on wouldn't be possible without the great work on 
[python-iview by Jeremy Visser] [python_iview].

Thanks also for contributions from:

Installation
------------
The latest stable release of this add-on is available as part of the
[XBMC CatchUp TV AU repository] [repository]. This is the recommended method
for installation, as it'll automatically update the iView add-on when fixes
are released.

See the [XBMC CatchUp TV AU repository] [repository] README for installation
steps.

If you would like to test the latest development version, you can grab the
[GitHub generated ZIP file] [githubzip]. It is recommended to set up and
install the stable version from the repository first to ensure all the
required dependencies are installed.

Issues
------
For any issues or bug reports, please file them on the [issues page] [issues].

Please include log output if possible, and the easiest way is with the Kodi
Log Uploader add-on. See this [great guide] [logfile] for steps.
